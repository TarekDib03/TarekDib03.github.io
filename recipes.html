  	<p>Mutabbal is a Levant dish found through out Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Egypt. It is a delicious and healthy dish, particulary for vegetarian. One could eat Mutabbal by dipping it in Pita bread or any other kind of bread, or one could eat it with a spoon. Many have Mutabbal as a starter, however, it could be a full meal, especially if accompanied by salad and pickles on the side. Mutabbal is made of roasted, peeled and mashed eggplant, blended with tahini, mashed garlic, salt and lemon juice. It is normally served with a dressing of extra virgin olive oil. In addition, many people may also eat it with mint, or may spray it with chopped parsely.</p>
